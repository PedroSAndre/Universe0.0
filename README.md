# Universe0.0
Personal clone of Game of Life developed in C++ using the SFML library.

## How to run
With a C++ compiler, CMake and SFML installed, run cmake and compile the project. It is possible to specify the number of pixels and blocks on the x and y axis using, respectively, the "-px", "-py", "-bx" and "-by" flags when running the executable.

## Controls
The space bar pauses/unpauses the game. The left and right arrow keys increase and decrease the speed of the game.
